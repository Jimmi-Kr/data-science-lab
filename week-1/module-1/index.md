This module is a self-contained introduction to the libraries `NumPy` and `Matplotlib`. The module is divided into five notebooks:

- Vectors
- Plotting Simple Curves
- Matrices
- Sampling from Distributions, Bar Plots, Histograms and Scatter plots
- NumPy arrays

We will start with the simplest of `NumPy` arrays, 1D arrays that can be used to represent vectors. Then we will look at simple line plots that we can draw with `Matplotlib`. Then we move on to 2D arrays that can be used to represent matrices. From there, we study how we can sample from distributions and represent samples using plots such as histograms and scatter plots. Finally, we return to `NumPy` arrays and study them in greater detail.

The five notebooks are best read in the order presented here. If you are already familiar with some of the basic concepts of `NumPy` or `Matplotlib`, then you can pick and choose whatever seems unfmailiar.
